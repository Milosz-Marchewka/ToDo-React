# Simple React To-Do App

This is my first simple project built to learn React. I started this after about 2.5 hours of experimenting with the framework, and it helps me get comfortable with components, state management and other stuff that I will stumble upon while trying to create yet one more feature.

## Features

- Add tasks with names, descriptions, and due dates
- Sort tasks by creation date, due date, or status (complete/incomplete)
- Reset due date to current date and time with a button
- Visual feedback for invalid due dates (cannot set a due date in the past)
- Light and dark theme support (mostly done as of 21/06)

## Technologies Used

- React
- LocalStorage for task persistence
- CSS for styling

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server
4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` to use the app

## Why I Built This
This project is my first "playground" to learn React, and why not with something practical and extendable? 
So far this app helped me unstand state, events, conditional components and many more.
